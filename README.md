Hello, World! 

Danielle here! I was accepted into The Coding Boot Camp at UNC-Chapel Hill. Woohoo! 
I am very excited and  hopeful.  I intend to be an excellent web developer some day!
I hope to be a role model and inspire others to learn to code!

As my admissions advisor always says... "Make today a great day!"

Peace, Love and Joy!
